## Coding guidelines

Contributions to TogetherStream should use the good coding style. Please refer to the [Swift API coding guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and best practices for other languages.

## Documentation

All code changes should include comments describing the design, assumptions, dependencies, and non-obvious aspects of the implementation.
Hopefully the existing code provides a good example of appropriate code comments.
If necessary, make the appropriate updates in the README.md and other documentation files.

## Contributing your changes

1. If one does not exist already, open an issue that your contribution is going to resolve or fix.
    1. Make sure to give the issue a clear title and a very focused description.
2. Make a branch from the develop branch using the following naming convention:
    1. `YOUR_INITIALS/ISSUE#-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME`
    2. For example, `kb/94-create-contributingmd` was the branch that had the commit containing this
    tutorial.
3. Commit your changes!
4. When you have completed making all your changes, create a Pull Request (PR) from your git manager
or our Github repo from your branch to master.
5. Fill in the template for the PR.
6. Contributions require sign-off. We require that any contributers agree to the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin), otherwise your pull request will be rejected.
    1. When committing using the command line you can sign off using the --signoff or -s flag. This adds a Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message.`git commit -s -m "Commit message"`
7. That's it, thanks for the contribution!
